# Django Learning Repository

Welcome to my Django learning repository! This is where I will be tracking my progress as I work through various Django courses. The files and projects here are created as part of my learning journey.

## Courses I'm Following

1. [Django Python Course - Beginner](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python/?couponCode=24T1MT101824)

2. [Django Python Advanced Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/?couponCode=24T1MT101824)

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to document and showcase the exercises, projects, and notes from the courses. It will include code samples, project configurations, and other useful resources as I work my way through the material.

Feel free to explore the different folders and projects as I continue learning!
